# BP3 Angular Frontend
Thank you for participating in the BP3 Coding Exercise. This is a small Angular project that captures the essence of 
the type of work that we do here at BP3. The exercise should only take an hour or two to complete.

## Exercise Summary
Here at BP3 we work with BPM process diagrams a great deal. This exercise has to do with removing the non-human steps
from a process diagram and listing only the human steps along with the start and end nodes.

## Important Information
There are a couple of directories to note:
* **Requirements Document** - The detailed requirements for the project are found in the `docs` directory in the file 
named `BP3 Coding Challenge.pdf`. If there are differences between this `README` and the `BP3 Coding Challenge.pdf`
the `BP3 Coding Challenge.pdf` should be considered correct.
* **Project Data** - The JSON data files to be used are found in the `data` directory.

## Prerequisites
* Ensure you have Node.js version 14 or greater

## Running the JSON Data Server
A small HTTP server is provided to produce the JSON data needed by your Angular application. You can start it by 
running `npm run data-server` which will start the server listening on port `3000`.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
